# Understanding Data Science

### Summary
This project is meant to help people understand data science better through explanation and example.

### About Me
I recently completed a data science immersive program but I am still a little fuzzy in many areas.  I am hoping to get a deep enough understanding of the different areas of data science that I can easily explain them to other people.  This project is as much for me to learn data science better as it is to teach other people how the different applications of data science work.
