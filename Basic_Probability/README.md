### Probability of an Event
"The probability of event A is the number of ways event A can occur divided by the total number of  possible outcomes." [reference](http://www.mathgoodies.com/lessons/vol6/intro_probability.html)

I think it's best to explain probability by giving examples.

### Roll the Dice
Example 1

What is the probability of rolling one number on a six sided fair die?
``` python
# coming soon...
```
``` output
> ?
```
