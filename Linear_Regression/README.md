### Summary
Linear regression is a modeling technique that involves finding a line of best fit through a set of data points.  Having an equation for the line allows you to makes predictions of things that haven't happened yet.  

Pros:
 - Easy to set up and run
 - Not computationally intensive
 - Can be useful if your data appears to be following a certain trend
 - Provides an easy to explain feature space

Cons:
 - Doesn't work in many real world scenarios
 - Data tends to be too complex for a linear model

### Linear Equation
I think we all learned the y = mx + b equation back in high school algebra.  :)
